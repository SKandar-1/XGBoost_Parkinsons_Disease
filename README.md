# XGBoost_Parkinsons_Disease

__Abstract:__

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a slowly progressive chronic neurologic condition which causes a gradual loss of the nerve cells in the brain. Roughly six million people worldwide suffer from Parkinson’s disease. Hyperparameter optimization was performed on the XGBoost algorithm machine learning model for the UCI ML Parkinson’s disease dataset which contains features extracted from 195 sustained vowel phonations from 31 male and female subjects, of which 23 were diagnosed with PD. This model was able to predict Parkinson's disease with 100% accuracy on the testing dataset, i.e., no false positive or false negative result was predicted.

__Introduction:__

Parkinson’s disease is second only to Alzheimer’s disease as the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. (Reference 1) Despite extensive research, there is no known cause, cure, or prevention for Parkinson’s disease but the symptoms can be alleviated significantly with medication especially if correct diagnosis is obtained at the early stage of the disease. Little et al. from University of Oxford published a study on the Suitability of Dysphonia Measurements
for Telemonitoring of Parkinson’s Disease in 2008 where they were able achieve overall correct classification performance of 91.4%, using a kernel support vector machine. (Reference 2) In this study the default parameters for the XGBoost Classifier Model yielded an accuracy of 94% and after hyperparameter tuning the accuracy went up to 100%.
