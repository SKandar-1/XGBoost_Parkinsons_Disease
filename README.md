# XGBoost_Parkinsons_Disease

__Abstract:__

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a slowly progressive chronic neurologic condition which causes a gradual loss of the nerve cells in the brain. Roughly six million people worldwide suffer from Parkinson’s disease. Hyperparameter optimization was performed on the XGBoost algorithm machine learning model for the UCI ML Parkinson’s disease dataset which contains features extracted from 195 sustained vowel phonations from 31 male and female subjects, of which 23 were diagnosed with PD. This model was able to predict Parkinson's disease with 100% accuracy on the testing dataset, i.e., no false positive or false negative result was predicted.
